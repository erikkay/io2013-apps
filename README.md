The window will stick to the right side of your screen and isn't movable.


## Credits

This is code was originally based on Eric Bidelman's HTML5 slide template.  Mihai Parparita and I
hacked on it a bit to make the app we used for our 2012 I/O presentation.  This is a copy of that
with a bunch of things thrown out.  There's a lot of unnecessary cruft as a result of this, so
don't look at this as a model.
